# Contributing to Hotaru

As an open source CCL training tool, Hotaru welcomes all the CCL learners and developers to contribute to the community.

## As A Developer

### Find A Bug

If you detected some bugs in the code or unexpected results while using the app, you can nominate it in Issue by adding the **bug** tag at it. You are of course welcomed to try to fix it yourself, and you can contribute by merging it to the `main` branch via creating a pull request.

### New features

If you have an idea in mind that might be an interesting feature for Hotaru, you can also nominate it in Issue by adding the **enhancement** tag. The maintainers will review it, and it might be developed and launched in future versions. We would also encourage you to try to develop it yourselves, and you can can contribute by merging it to the `main` branch via creating a pull request.

### Write Documents

If you find any flaws in some existing documents, you can fix it in your own branch and create a pull request. We would appreciate it if you can make sure that your pull request's title starts with **\[doc\]**.

## As A CCL Learner

`Don't worry, you don't have to know how to code to make contributions.`

### Find A Bug

You might find some difficulties while using Hotaru, don't just take it for granted! We would appreciate it if you can nominate it in the Issue board.

We would appreciate it if you could attach some more images or video to better describe your delima, so it would be easier for our developers to fix them.

### New features

When you are practicing CCL with Hotaru, you may have a flash of inspiration and think of some functions that may help your practice, but not provided by Hotaru yet. Don't hide it! It could help us to improve if you can nominate it in the Issue board.

It doesn't have to be very professional, our developers might contact you to help if we find your idea is interesting, and worth developing.

### More Audio Sample ðŸŒŸ

As time goes by, there will be more and more exam recordings worth practicing, unfortunately our development team cannot guarantee that they will continue to maintain them in the future.

**Please don't blame them for this**, as Hotaru advocates a free development environment, it is perfectly legitimate for some developers to choose not to contribute any more after they passes the CCL exam themselves, which is also worth congratulating ðŸŽ‰.

**Luckily, we have you!** It is not a difficult task and does not require any expertise to create audio sample information. All you need is to be familiar with the CCL exam process and have an audio player. There will be more instructions on how to create audio sample.

After you created your own audio sample information, you can added it to the audio_config.json file and create a pull request to contribute, our maintainer will review and test your modification and merge it to `main` if there is no issue with it.

We would appreciate it if you can test it on your local environment and follow code of conduct.
